Per RESPA guidelines, the company is allowed to implement a cushion comprised of two months of escrow payments, but they are not required to do so. In order to pay my mortgage without undue strain on my finances, I have respectfully requested Wells Fargo waive the requirement as a courtesy. I was continually lied to on the phone by agents of Wells Fargo, who stated that the cushion was required under the law. I advised them this is incorrect, and that it is an internal business decision to require the cushion. My call was escalated to an escalation team, and after speaking with an agent named XXXX, was advised after no contact for two weeks that they flatly denied my request, providing no other reasoning other beyond \" other servicers may have different requirements but Wells Fargo requires the cushion. \\'\\' I do not dispute that there was an increase in the amount of my escrow obligation, but the requirement of the \" cushion \\'\\' is not federally mandated, and it is fully within the ability of the company to waive the cushion in order to better accommodate the needs of one of their customers. I have been nothing but respectful in my interactions with the company, and yet now they leave me out to dry. I need assistance so that I can continue to pay my mortgage. I am a first time homebuyer, but have years of experience in the mortgage industry, and it is shameful the way that Wells Fargo treats their customers, especially in light of their XXXX XXXX dollar settlement due to unfair practices.

Per RESPA guidelines, the company is allowed to implement a cushion comprised of two months of escrow payments, but they are not required to do so. In order to pay my mortgage without undue strain on my finances, I have respectfully requested Wells Fargo waive the requirement as a courtesy. I was continually lied to on the phone by agents of Wells Fargo, who stated that the cushion was required under the law. I advised them this is incorrect, and that it is an internal business decision to require the cushion. My call was escalated to an escalation team, and after speaking with an agent named XXXX, was advised after no contact for two weeks that they flatly denied my request, providing no other reasoning other beyond \" other servicers may have different requirements but Wells Fargo requires the cushion. \\'\\' I do not dispute that there was an increase in the amount of my escrow obligation, but the requirement of the \" cushion \\'\\' is not federally mandated, and it is fully within the ability of the company to waive the cushion in order to better accommodate the needs of one of their customers. I have been nothing but respectful in my interactions with the company, and yet now they leave me out to dry. I need assistance so that I can continue to pay my mortgage. I am a first time homebuyer, but have years of experience in the mortgage industry, and it is shameful the way that Wells Fargo treats their customers, especially in light of their XXXX XXXX dollar settlement due to unfair practices. You\\'d think they would like to help their customers in order to raise their respectability in the public eye, but it turns out that is not the case.'"
